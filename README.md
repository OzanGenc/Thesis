# Thesis
The codes that are used in my master thesis of 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Differential Diagnosis and Prognosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's Disease Using Machine Learning'. I write the MATLAB codes to analyze multi-modal longitudinal MRI data of Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients having Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). In addition, I worked with feature selection methods in order to select the most informative features for classifying PD-MCI, PD normal and Healthy Controls. In the jupyter notebook I have experimented with tree based recursive feature selection algorithms.
